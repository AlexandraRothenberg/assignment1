        <p><strong>Grouplove</strong> is a US-based band that formed in 2009 by Hannah Hooper (vocals, keys), Christian Zucconi (vocals, guitar), Sean Gadd (bass, vocals), Andrew Wessen (guitar, vocals), and Ryan Rabin (drums).</p>
        
        <p class="dropcap">Grouplove formed out of a friendship between the five members of the band. Hooper met Zucconi on the Lower East Side of Manhattan after hearing, and enjoying, his music. Despite having just met, Hooper invited Zucconi to an artist residency in Crete she was leaving for later that week. It was at this retreat where they met the rest of the band, Andrew Wessen, Ryan Rabin and Sean Gadd. Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, grew up in Los Angeles with Wessen, a surfer and guitarist. Rabin comes from a musical family - his father is Trevor Rabin, former guitarist of Yes. Sean Gadd, a songwriter and guitarist from London, was also at the commune. The friendship between the members formed quickly, but the band did not form until a year later after Gadd, Zucconi and Hooper pooled their funds together and made a trip to Rabin's Los Angeles recording studio. They played their first show at El Cid in Los Angeles on May 10, 2010. Later that year, the band went on tour with Florence and The Machine on the west coast, and then Joy Formidable on the east coast.</p>
